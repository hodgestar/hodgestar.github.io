What is the most important thing you've learned in the last two weeks?
======================================================================

Django framework. More broadly, frameworks in general. It's EASY to get a basic
website running.

Don't be afraid of asking questions. "No such thing as a stupid question."

Zope interfaces.

Testing is hard but helps show problems with implementations.

Asynchronous programming is a thing. Always return a deferred.

Manage your time properly.

Use "majority world" instead of "third world" and the like.

I learnt that I do actually love coding. I had some doubts before, but after
working at Praekelt, I'm sure.


What makes a good programming concept?
======================================

Atomic, general, simple, clear.

Contains everything it needs to function but nothing more.

Data structure.

What it IS and IS NOT is clearly defined (e.g. + button on a calculator adds
things, it is not a concatenator).
